Facial recognition of an individual from an image

Directory : Detection
This code is for detecting faces from images stored in the directory 'images'
Both the Harr cascade and LBP (Local Binary Partioning) cascade is used and a comparison between the two is made in terms of time taken.
The output images show the images with faces detected with a green rectangle over the faces.

To run the file: 
Download/Clone the repository
Run the file faces.py

You can also add or change the images present in the images folder to try out images of your own
